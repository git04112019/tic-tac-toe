Text-based TicTacToe game that uses minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to ensure the game is always either a win or a tie, as is possible with TicTacToe. I created this as an exercise to become more familiar with Python and with Numpy, and I will try to improve it further by taking into account rotational invariance.

To run this, make sure you have Python 3.6 installed on your computer, then run `python3 game.py`.
